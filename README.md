# Luke's bad jokes
_An Alexa skill for those times when you just need a cheesy joke!_

## What's this?

This is an Alexa skill I made over a week off work to do something fun with AWS Lambda and learn more about event-driven architecture. 

The skill is written in Node.js and based off the "hello world" boilerplate generated by the [Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html), which I then converted to TypeScript.

The Lambda backend is hosted on AWS.

## What does it do?

[Try it out for yourself here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Luke-Rogerson-Lukes-jokes/dp/B087CXFGR3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=luke's+jokes&qid=1587890806&s=digital-skills&sr=1-1)! Basically, you can ask it to tell you a bad joke about ____ , or to just tell you a joke. It grabs and filters the best jokes based on your query from Reddit's [r/dadjokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/)!

## Can I use it as a base for my Node.js + TypeScript Alexa skill?

Of course! All of the source code for the skill is located in this repo. Feel free to clone it, copy it, change it, whatever.

[Here is a blog post](https://lukerogerson.me/blog/alexa-skill-nodejs-typescript/alexa-skill-nodejs-typescript/) I wrote about building it, which basically details the entire process and hopefully gets you over some earlier stumbling blocks that I faced!

Eventually, I want to create an opinionated boilerplate for building an Alexa skill in Node.js and TypeScript! Look out for that!
